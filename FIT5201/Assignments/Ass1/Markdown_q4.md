Since the chance of picking the red box is 40%, the probabilities of selecting either the red or the blue boxes are given by

 $p(B=r)=0.4$, $p(B=b)=0.6$. 

 There are 2 apples and 6 oranges in the red box, while 3 apples and 1 oranges are in the blue box. Then, since the selection change for any of the pieces from a box is equal, we can have:

$p(F=a|B=r)=0.25$, $p(F=o|B=r)=0.75$, $p(F=a|B=b)=0.75$, $p(F=o|B=b)=0.25$

By the use of the sum and product rules of probability:

$p(F=o)=p(F=o|B=r)p(B=r)+p(F=o|B=b)p(B=b)=0.75\times0.4+0.25\times0.6=0.45$ 

By using Bayes' theorem:

$p(B=b|F=o)=\cfrac{p(F=o|B=b)p(B=b)}{p(F=o)}=\cfrac{0.25\times0.6}{0.45}=\cfrac{1}{3}$

Hence, If the pricked fruit is an orange, the probability that it was picked from the blue box is $\cfrac{1}{3}$.
